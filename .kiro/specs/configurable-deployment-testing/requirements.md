# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the OTP smoke testing system from a hardcoded deployment configuration to a flexible, configuration-driven approach. Currently, each test suite has deployment details (URL, deployment name) hardcoded in the constructor, and all tests run on a fixed 10-minute schedule. The new system will allow multiple deployments to be defined in configuration files, with flexible scheduling and the ability to run different test suites against different deployments at varying intervals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: External Deployment Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define OTP deployments in a configuration file, so that I can easily manage multiple environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load deployment configurations from an external configuration file
2. WHEN a deployment configuration is defined THEN it SHALL include deployment name and OTP URL
3. WHEN deployment configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without application restart
4. IF a deployment configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL log an error and skip that deployment
5. WHEN no valid deployments are configured THEN the system SHALL start but not schedule any tests

### Requirement 2: Test Suite to Deployment Mapping

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to specify which test suites run against which deployments, so that I can control testing scope per environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring deployments THEN it SHALL be possible to specify a list of test suites to run against each deployment
2. WHEN a test suite is specified for multiple deployments THEN it SHALL run independently against each deployment
3. WHEN a deployment has multiple test suites THEN each test suite SHALL run independently with separate metrics
4. IF a test suite class cannot be found THEN the system SHALL log an error and skip that test suite for the deployment
5. WHEN no test suites are configured for a deployment THEN no tests SHALL be scheduled for that deployment

### Requirement 3: Flexible Scheduling Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure different execution intervals for each test suite on each deployment, so that I can optimize testing frequency based on criticality and resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring test suite mappings THEN it SHALL be possible to specify execution intervals using cron expressions or simple interval notation
2. WHEN different intervals are specified THEN each test suite SHALL run independently according to its configured schedule
3. WHEN the same test suite runs on multiple deployments THEN each deployment SHALL have independent scheduling
4. IF an invalid schedule expression is provided THEN the system SHALL log an error and use a default interval
5. WHEN schedule configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL reschedule tasks without restart

### Requirement 4: Decoupled Test Suite Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test suites to be independent of deployment configuration, so that the same test logic can run against any compatible deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test suites are instantiated THEN they SHALL receive deployment configuration as parameters rather than having it hardcoded
2. WHEN a test suite runs THEN it SHALL use the deployment configuration provided at runtime
3. WHEN test suite constructors are called THEN they SHALL only contain test-specific configuration
4. WHEN deployment-specific configuration changes THEN test suite code SHALL not require modification
5. WHEN new deployments are added THEN existing test suites SHALL work without code changes

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Metrics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want metrics to be tagged with deployment information, so that I can monitor the health of each deployment independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN metrics SHALL be tagged with deployment name and test suite name
2. WHEN viewing metrics THEN it SHALL be possible to filter by deployment, test suite, or both
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN they SHALL be tagged with the specific deployment that failed
4. WHEN multiple deployments are tested THEN each SHALL have independent success/failure counters
5. WHEN generating reports THEN deployment-specific statistics SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Configuration Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear error messages when configuration is invalid, so that I can quickly identify and fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate all deployment configurations
2. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the problem
3. WHEN a deployment becomes unreachable THEN the system SHALL continue testing other deployments
4. WHEN configuration files are malformed THEN the system SHALL start with default configuration and log errors
5. WHEN test execution fails THEN error messages SHALL include deployment context information
